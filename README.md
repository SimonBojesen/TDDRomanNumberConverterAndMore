Reflection tasks:

Shooting:
A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List
the possible reasons for the man not dying.

List:
- She hit a non-vital part of the man

Alien:
An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume
that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it
needs a clear step-by-step instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as
you can. 

Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap
anti-clockwise; Put some water on your toothbrush; Press on the 
tube of toothpaste, so a little comes and, and put it on your toothbrush;
Now you just brush your teeth, either back and forth or in small circles;
When you feel like you have brushed your teeth enough, you spit out the toothpaste;
Then you rinse your mouth, and your toothbrush with water, and you are done.

Thoughts on TDD:
I had a lot of trouble in the beginning, but it quickly got 
easier and easier as I began picking up the gist of it.

I can definitely see how it can help with writing tests you might not 
think of not for me though. 

These tasks felt like they didn't need a lot of tests
to cover the assignment. In a bigger program this would seem way 
more useful. It was fun though.
