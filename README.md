Alien:
An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume
that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it
needs a clear step-by-step instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as
you can. 

Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap
anti-clockwise; Put some water on your toothbrush; Press on the 
tube of toothpaste so a little comes and, and put it on your toothbrush;
Now you just brush your teeth, either back and forth or in small circles;
When you feel like you have brushed your teeth enough, you spit out the toothpaste;
Then you rinse your mouth and your toothbrush with water and you are done.
